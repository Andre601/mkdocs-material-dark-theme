# MkDocs Material Theme

This is based on  the squidfunk's [material theme](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) for [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org). It builds on the material theme by adding a dark mode, where all the changes to the CSS are in [this file](https://github.com/henrywhitaker3/mkdocs-material-dark-theme/blob/master/docs/assets/css/dark-theme.css). 

A live demo is hosted on github pages [here](https://henrywhitaker3.github.io/mkdocs-material-dark-theme/)

## Using the dark theme

Download [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/henrywhitaker3/mkdocs-material-dark-theme/master/docs/assets/css/dark-theme.css) CSS file and place it wherever you want in your MkDocs `docs` folder, in this example, I chose `assets/css/dark-theme.css`
